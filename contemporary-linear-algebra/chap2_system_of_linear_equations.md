# System of Linear Equations

Q: Every matrix with two or more columns is an augmented matrix for some system of linear equations.
A: Yes, that's correct. An augmented matrix is essentially a way of representing a system of linear equations in a compact form. Each row in the matrix corresponds to a linear equation, each column corresponds to a coefficient of a variable, and the last column corresponds to the constant terms on the right side of the equations.

Q: so [1, 1] ?
A: Yes, even a matrix with a single row and two columns, such as [1, 1], can be considered an augmented matrix for a system of linear equations.
In this case, the matrix [1, 1] corresponds to a single linear equation:

1x = 1

This is a very simple system of linear equations with just one 
equation and one variable.
